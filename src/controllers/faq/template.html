            <p class="font">Why do companies publish the same job ads over a long period of time?</p>
            <p>
                The typical reasons include: companies that are just entering 
                the market or are actively expanding; lack of sufficient 
                suitable candidates with specialized experience and knowledge; 
                within companies with a large number of employees it is normal 
                to regularly have employees changing their position.
            </p>
            
            <p class="font">What is and is not permitted in the job ads?</p>
            <p>
                The job ad should include all information necessary for the
                candidates to apply. To ensure efficient and comfortable 
                environment and prevent using the job ads for promotion of 
                products or services,we do not allow that the candidates
                are required to join Facebook groups, etc.
                The companies can include their corporate website, 
                as well other additional information in their company profile 
                page.
                It is up to the company to decide whether to include a contact
                person and a telephone number in the job ad text.

            <p class="font">Why don't companies usually list their telephone contacts?</p>
            <p>
                Considering the significant number of candidates â€“ from a few 
                hundred to a few thousand, a large number of companies do not
                have the technical capacity to answer telephone calls. Due to 
                this reason the companies usually do not list their telephone 
                contacts. It is up to the company to decide whether to include 
                a contact person and a telephone number in the job ad text.

            <p class="font">Do other employers have access to my CV and contacts?</p>
            <p>
                No. The employers can access only the applications they have 
                received to their job ads.
            </p>
            
            <p class="font"> Is the employer required to pay a fee to view my CV?</p>
            <p>
                No, there is no such requirement. The employers have full access
                in real time to absolutely all applications they have received
                to their job ads, regardless of the job type.
            </p>
            
            <p class="font"> Does the employer see the contact details I have provided?</p>
            <p>
                Yes, for the job ads you have applied to, the employer has full
                access to the contact details you have provided (phone, email, etc.)
                and the available information in your CV.
