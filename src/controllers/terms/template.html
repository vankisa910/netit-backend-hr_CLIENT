<p>The Terms of Service Agreement is mainly used for legal purposes by companies
which provide software or services, such as web browsers, e-commerce, web 
search engines, social media, and transport services.

A legitimate terms-of-service agreement is legally binding and may be subject 
to change.Companies can enforce the terms by refusing service. Customers 
can enforce by filing a lawsuit or arbitration case if they can show they were
actually harmed by a breach of the terms. There is a heightened risk of data 
going astray during corporate changes, including mergers, divestitures, buyouts,
downsizing, etc., when data can be transferred improperly.
